Debian testing releases have no version number.  But their codename is
available. For example, as of this writing Trixie is a testing version
and will become version 13.

Create a numeric <version>.yml file for the next release and a symbolic
link from the codename to it. A Single Role task will detect the missing
version number and replace it with the (lower case) codename.
