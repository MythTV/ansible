Debian testing releases have no version number. But their codename is
available. For example as of this writing, Trixie is a testing version
and will become v13.

Create a numeric <version>.yml file for the next release and a symbolic
link from the codename to it. The single role will detect the missing
version number and replace it with the (lower case) codename.
