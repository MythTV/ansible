The user_options.yml file is NOT maintained by git. It's here for
users to add information unique to their MythTV Ansible playbook
runs. A git pull won't overwrite it.

Variables set here will override those in the all.yml file in this
directory. The full Ansible precedence list can be found here:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html
Command line settings (like: --extra-vars='{"qt6": true}') would override settings
here.

The contents of a user_options.yml file could look like the following -
things between the long underscore lines:
_______________________________________________________________________

---

# Set to false to enable use of the Single Role
use_old_roles: false

# Set to true to create a Python Virtual Environment:
venv_active: true

# Change the default Virtual Environment path from ~/.virtualenvs/mythtv
# to somewhere else:
# venv_path: /something/you_prefer

# Set this to true to load Qt6 packages rather than Qt5:
qt6: false

...
