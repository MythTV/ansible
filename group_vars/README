The user_options.yml file is NOT maintained by git. It's here for
users to add information unique to their MythTV Ansible playbook
runs. A git pull won't overwrite it.

Variables set here will override those in the all.yml file in this
directory. The full Ansible precedence list can be found here:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html

Command line settings (like: --extra-vars='{"qt6": true}') would override settings
here.

The contents of a user_options.yml file could contain things between the long
underscore lines (which have the default values listed). Choose, and uncomment
none, one, some or all.
