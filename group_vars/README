The user_options.yml file is NOT maintained by git. It's here for
users to add information unique to their MythTV Ansible playbook
runs.

The Ansible precedence list can be found here:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html

The contents of a user_options.yml file would look like the following -
everything between the long underscore lines:
_____________________________________________________________________

---

# Create a Python Virtual Environment:
venv_active: true

# Change the default Virtual Environment path from ~/.virtualenvs/mythtv
# to somewhere else:
# venv_path: /something/you_prefer

# Turn this on to load Qt6 packages rather than Qt5:
qt6: false

...
